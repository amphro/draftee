A webapp for doing in-person fantasy NFL auction drafts


How to use
=======
Draftee is designed to use two APIs:
 * Yahoo BOSS Image Search
 * A source of JSON NFL Player Data (which is not included for copyright reasons)
 
You will want to modify the index.js routes file to accomodate your JSON player data source.
